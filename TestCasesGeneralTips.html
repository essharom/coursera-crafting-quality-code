<h2>General Tips</h2>					

<p>
	When choosing test cases, consider the following factors:
</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Size</b><br>
		For collections (<code>strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries</code>) test with:
		<ul>
			<li>empty collection
			<li>a collection with 1 item
			<li>smallest interesting case
			<li>collection with several items		
		</ul>
		<li><b>Dichotomies</b><br>
			Consider your situation:<br>
		<br>
		For example:
		<ul>
			<li>vowels/non-vowels
			<li>even/odd
			<li>positive/negative
			<li>empty/full
			<li>etc.
		</ul>
		<li><b>Boundaries</b><br>
			If a function behaves differently for a value near a particular threshold (i.e. an <code>if</code> statement checking when a value is 3; 3 is a threshold), test at that threshold.
		<li><b>Order</b><br>
			If a function behaves differently when the values are in a different order, identify and test each of those orders.
	</ul>
<p>
	There is often overlap between the categories, so one test case may fall into more than 1 category.<br>
